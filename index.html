          <strong>History</strong>
          <hr>
          German shepherd dogs are, as their name implies, a breed that originated in Germany. They were developed beginning in the late 1800s by crossing various herding breeds. The breed was subjected to stringent selection and it progressed quickly. In the United Kingdom, the dogs are known as Alsatians because fanciers of the breed there wanted to protect the dog from anti-German sentiments after World War I.
          German shepherd dogs were introduced in the United States by soldiers returning home from World War I. The breed caught the public eye because of movie stars Strongheart and later, Rin Tin Tin. By World War II German shepherd dogs were the military breed of choice. The first guide dogs were German shepherd dogs. Today, they are one of the most popular dogs in America. In 1999, German shepherd dogs were third on the American Kennel Club's list of the Top 50 Breeds.
          The German shepherd dog is a herding breed known for its courage, loyalty and guarding instincts. This breed makes an excellent guard dog, police dog, military dog, guide dog for the blind and search and rescue dog. For many families, the German shepherd is also a treasured family pet.

          <strong>Temperament & Behavior</strong>
          <hr>
            German Shepherds are renowned to be confident, fearless, alert, and suspicious of potential dangers. Careful breeding made them ready and willing to nab the bad guys, whether they are wolves in the flock or enemy troops. they are eager to do whatever duty appointed. There are working and companion or show bloodlines that influence the intensity of an individual dog. Working dogs are not meant to be companions as they are high-energy and have a high prey drive.
            When they are off the clock, German Shepherds are gentle and generally not high-strung. They are relaxed, calm, and even-tempered, neither overly excitable nor lethargic. A well-balanced German Shepherd can weigh situations independently before jumping into action, but they walk a fine line. Some dogs that have confidence issues or a lack of leadership are prone to snapping. German Shepherds, like other dogs with herding instincts, tend to be on the nippy side, and unfortunately this breed tops the list of frequent biters. This is a tendency that needs to be mediated and carefully monitored.
